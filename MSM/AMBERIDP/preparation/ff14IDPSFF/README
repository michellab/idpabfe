This is a README text describing the concept and the usage of perl
script "Trans_FF_IDPs".
Referring to DOI: 10.1021/acs.jcim.7b00135

Recently, we developed a specific force field ff14IDPSFF based 
on AMBER ff14SB with dihedral energy map correction (CMAP) method 
to simulate Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPs). This force 
fields need to transplant CHARMM energy function to AMBER's, 
which can be realized by "Trans_FF_IDPs".

=============
Simple Usages:
=============
1. Use Amber tLEaP or xLEaP to generate the normal PRMTOP file.
   Note: Please be sure to use ff14SB force field (source leaprc.ff14SB), 
	since the development is based on ff14SB.
2. Copy all the files to the same directory with the PRMTOP file
	or anywhere else. I will take the same directory as example.
3. Add executable permission onto Trans_FF_IDPs if it hasn't:
	
	$ chmod +x Trans_FF_IDPs
	
4. Run the script with "-p" flag to specify the NORMAL PRMTOP file
	and "-o" flag to name the new PRMTOP file with CMAP parameters,
	and "-c" flag to specify CMAP parameter file (CMAP_parameter_ff14IDPSFF):

	$ perl ./Trans_FF_IDPs -p OLD_PRMTOP -o NEW_PRMTOP -c ./CMAP_parameter_ff14IDPSFF
	
	Then an interacting UI will guild you to finish the trans-
	planting.
5. Followings are the optional flags and their explanations:
	-c	Optional.
		Specify CMAP parameter file (CMAP_parameter_ff14IDPSFF.)
		Please make sure the parameter file is at the same directory with
			Trans_FF_IDPs!

	-s	Silent Mode, optional.
		Run the script silently without any interacting UI.
		Note: In silent mode, all the proteins in the PRMTOP would
			be considered as IDP. And all the modified amino acids
			will be omitted.

	-h	Show the help information.
	-v	Show version information.
