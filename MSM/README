MD runs for the c-Myc project. 

The 3 runs used for the MSM model were:
1. AMBERIDP
2. CHARMM36
3. FF14SB

The following files and directories/folders have been generated:
AMBERIDP/
Contains the topology, force-field parameters, and configuration files needed to perform 20 μs MD simulations using the ff14IDPSFF/GAFF2 force field and GROMACS 5.0.5 software, which produce the output trajectories used for MSM model construction.

CHARMM36/
Contains the topology, force-field parameters, and configuration files needed to perform 20 μs MD simulations using the Charmm36m/Charmm force field and GROMACS 5.0.5 software, which produce the output trajectories used for MSM model construction.

FF14SB/
Contains the topology, force-field parameters, and configuration files needed to perform 20 μs MD simulations using the ff14SB/GAFF2 force field and SOMD 2019.1.0 software, which produce the output trajectories used for MSM model construction.
